## Introduction

This Arduino sketch provides a basic stack machine simulator, allowing you to push and pop values from a stack and perform arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and division) using simple commands. It's designed for educational purposes and can be used as a starting point for learning about stack-based systems and basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Push values onto the stack.
- Pop values from the stack.
- Perform addition, multiplication, and division operations.
- Error handling for stack underflow and division by zero.
- Interaction via the Arduino Serial Monitor.

## Requirements

To use the Arduino Stack Machine Simulator, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Arduino IDE or online IDE (e.g., Tinkercad for simulation)
- Serial communication tool (e.g., Arduino Serial Monitor, Tinkercad's Serial Monitor)

## Usage

1. **Upload the provided Arduino sketch:**
   - Use the Arduino IDE or compatible online platforms to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

2. **Open the Arduino Serial Monitor:**
   - Navigate to Tools -> Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE or use a serial communication tool if you're using Tinkercad.

3. **Enter instructions in the Serial Monitor:**
   - Supported commands include:
     - `PUSH <value>`: Push a floating-point value onto the stack.
     - `POP`: Pop the top value from the stack.
     - `ADD`: Perform addition on the top two stack values.
     - `MUL`: Perform multiplication on the top two stack values.
     - `DIV`: Perform division on the top two stack values (avoiding division by zero).

4. **Observe the stack's current state and operation results:**
   - View the Serial Monitor for real-time feedback on the stack's state and any operation results.

## Examples

Here are some example instructions you can enter in the Serial Monitor:

- `PUSH 42`: Push the value 42 onto the stack.
- `PUSH 10`: Push the value 10 onto the stack.
- `ADD`: Perform addition on the top two stack values.
- `MUL`: Perform multiplication on the top two stack values.
- `DIV`: Perform division on the top two stack values.
